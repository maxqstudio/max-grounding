# MAX Grounding

MAX Grounding is a self-hostable, evidence-first grounding engine for LLMs and agents.

The project is built in governed phases. Every phase follows:

```text
branch
→ implement
→ GitHub Actions acceptance
→ all required checks PASS
→ merge to main
→ revalidate main
```

No Owner-PC execution is part of the project acceptance authority.

## Target capabilities

- bounded live-web search orchestration;
- secure fetching and extraction of untrusted web content;
- deterministic lexical retrieval over fetched evidence;
- bounded dense semantic retrieval with role-separated embedding contracts;
- hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval;
- reranking and evidence compression;
- freshness and source-authority scoring;
- contradiction handling;
- claim-level citations and verification;
- REST and MCP interfaces;
- Linux, Windows, and macOS core-runtime support;
- Linux container images for `amd64` and `arm64`.

## Current phase

Phase 7 is a candidate for bounded provider-agnostic reranking and deterministic extractive evidence/context compression.

The candidate reranks at most 20 accepted hybrid hits through one injected bounded score sequence, rejects malformed or unbounded provider output fail-closed, preserves hybrid/lexical/semantic/source provenance, and compresses context without generation to at most 8 excerpts, 1200 characters per excerpt, and 6000 total excerpt characters.

The exact candidate still requires full pull-request Acceptance and post-merge main revalidation before Phase 7 is accepted. No concrete cross-encoder model/runtime, generative compression, quality benchmark, freshness/authority scoring, contradiction engine, claim verification, persistent vector database, REST, MCP, or production deployment is accepted yet.

## Platform policy

Native core-runtime acceptance runs on GitHub-hosted Linux, Windows, and macOS runners.
Service-heavy dependencies such as search engines, vector databases, model runtimes, and caches are isolated behind contracts and validated separately before they can become accepted capabilities.

## Governance

Project governance follows `maxqstudio/Skill_Workflow` pinned at:

`9e22feddb8f94e8c0f1af6a33e14b64de5068f8f`

Canonical human-facing governance documentation is generated under `docs/` from structured specs under `.workflow/`.
